# CHANGELOG.md

## [1.3.3] - 2025-09-13

### Fixed
- Fixed articles page display issues after Next.js 15.5.3 update
  - **Root Cause**: Next.js 15.5.3 update changed caching behavior and broke complex React.Children filtering logic
  - **Articles Display**: Fixed issue where only 4-5 articles were showing instead of all 28 articles and CodePens
  - **Search & Filter**: Restored broken search functionality and type filtering (All/Articles/CodePen)
  - **Even/Odd Styling**: Fixed missing alternating background colors for article cards
  - **Caching Strategy**: Updated caching approach for compatibility with new Next.js version

### Changed
- **ArticlesFilter Component**: Complete rewrite for better reliability
  - Replaced complex React.Children filtering with direct data rendering
  - Improved filtering logic to handle search and type filtering properly
  - Enhanced performance by eliminating unnecessary React element manipulation
- **Sanity Query Optimizations**:
  - Fixed field name mismatches (`main_image` vs `mainImage`) between query and schema
  - Added conditional image fetching for articles vs CodePens (articles use `main_image`, CodePens use `thumbnail`)
  - Improved error handling and data validation
  - Updated caching strategy: no-store in development, force-cache in production

### Added
- **Smooth Animations**: Restored and enhanced Framer Motion animations
  - **Article Entrance**: Staggered fade-in and slide-up animations (100ms delay on initial load, 50ms on filtering)
  - **Interactive Elements**: Scale animations for filter buttons (1.05x hover, 0.95x tap) and search input (1.02x focus)
  - **State Transitions**: AnimatePresence with popLayout mode for smooth filtering and reordering
  - **Hover Effects**: Enhanced arrow icon animations (45Â° rotation + 1.1x scale)
  - **Performance**: Optimized spring physics with proper damping for natural feel
- **Better User Experience**:
  - Visual feedback for all interactive elements
  - Smooth transitions between different filter states
  - Improved accessibility with proper animation timing

### Technical Improvements
- **Next.js 15.5.3 Compatibility**: Updated all components for latest Next.js version
- **Framer Motion**: Fixed deprecated `motion()` usage, now uses proper motion components
- **TypeScript**: Improved type safety for article data structures
- **Error Handling**: Better error boundaries and fallback states
- **Development Experience**: Disabled aggressive caching in development for better debugging
